# RELAX
Relax implements a semi-analytic Fourier-domain solver and equivalent body forces to compute quasi-static relaxation of stress perturbation.

Note: the github repo for RELAX can not be found now. Please download RELAX software from this website:
http://geodynamics.org/cig/software/relax/

Usage:
1. unzip the file
2. make one template for the studied case. In the template you should configure the basic parameters for you studied case.
3. use generate_script_RELAX_V2.py to generate templates batchly.
4. go to /Relax/examples/project_name/PBS_script
5. run ./run_RELAX to sub jobs to PBS/LSF or other cluster
